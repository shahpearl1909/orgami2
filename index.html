      <h2>Reflection on AI and Sustainability</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Integrating AI into food management has the potential to revolutionize how we approach sustainability in our everyday lives. AI can be used to optimize food usage, predict expiry dates, and suggest waste-conscious recipes. For example, through smart tracking and analysis, AI can alert users when items in their pantry or fridge are close to expiring, helping them to prioritize their consumption and minimize waste. Additionally, by analyzing food consumption patterns, AI can suggest recipes that utilize ingredients that are close to their expiration dates, reducing the chance of food being discarded. This creates a more sustainable food system where we get the most out of what we already have, reducing unnecessary waste and conserving resources.
        <br><br>
        In my project, I leveraged AI to make food management easier and smarter. By collecting data on the types of food being used or wasted, the app can suggest ways to use up leftovers or ingredients that users might not otherwise think to incorporate into their meals. In essence, AI serves as a virtual assistant that helps users optimize their food purchases and consumption, leading to a more sustainable lifestyle.

      <h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        One of the biggest challenges I faced while working on this project was figuring out how to present my idea effectively. While the concept itself—using AI to reduce food waste—is intuitive and impactful, conveying this in a clear, engaging way to potential users was key. I wanted the app to be accessible and easy to understand, especially since the concept of AI-powered food management might seem complex to some users.
        <br><br>
        Another challenge was designing the user experience (UX) in a way that’s both practical and engaging. The app needed to strike the right balance between being a useful tool for sustainability and not overwhelming the user with too much information or technical jargon. I spent a lot of time refining the user interface (UI) using Figma to make sure that everything was simple to navigate and visually appealing. Creating a website was also a crucial step, as it allowed me to showcase my project in a way that not only highlighted my skills but also demonstrated my passion for website development.

      <h2>Learning and Future Technology Interaction</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        This project has provided me with valuable insights into how AI can practically solve real-world problems, especially in the area of sustainability. I've learned that AI's ability to process large amounts of data quickly and make predictions can be incredibly useful in solving everyday issues like food waste. The technology's capacity to learn from user behavior and adapt accordingly allows for highly personalized recommendations, making it not only a tool for reducing waste but also one that fosters conscious consumption.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, I've gained experience in problem-solving within the context of AI. Developing AI-powered solutions isn't just about coding algorithms; it's also about understanding how people interact with technology, how they make decisions, and how AI can best fit into their lifestyles. I realized that sustainability is not just a technical issue—it’s a human one, and technology must be designed to complement human habits and improve them over time.

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Why This Format?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        I chose an app format for this project because it is intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible. Mobile apps are inherently designed for convenience, and with most people already using smartphones to manage their daily lives, having an app that integrates seamlessly into this environment makes it much more likely that people will actually use it. The app format also allows for scalability—as the app gains users, it can grow to include more features, support more languages, and integrate with other platforms or smart devices like fridges or pantry organizers.
        <br><br>
        From a user-centric perspective, an app allows for personalization and real-time updates, which makes the experience more engaging. The format allows me to integrate notifications for expiry tracking, smart recipe suggestions, and easy-to-read data on food waste, all in one place. Furthermore, the app can be flexible, adjusting its functionality based on user preferences—whether that's a quick reminder to use up food or a detailed breakdown of their waste patterns over time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        By incorporating AI into food management, I've been able to create a solution that not only makes it easier to manage food waste but also helps users make smarter, more sustainable decisions. The app format is ideal for this kind of project because it provides a simple, scalable, and intuitive way for users to interact with the technology. Through this competition, I’ve learned about the power of AI to address real-world issues and the importance of designing technology that is accessible, engaging, and capable of driving positive change.
